//writing a function:

    //1st way: function declaration

        function doSomething(){
            //code for doing "something"
        }

    //2nd way: function expression
        
        var doSomething = function(){
            /*code*/ 
        }

        //Obs: if a assign another value to doSomething variable we'll loose the function it was storing.
        

//Calling a function:
doSomething();

//Returning a function definition:
doSomething
